    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am Mexican born and my genuine passion for design 
        has accompanied me on my travels to my home in Vancouver, 
        BC. I am a colourful person and always try to think outside 
        the box in order to create something distinct and individual. 
        I love to be part of a fun, dedicated and positive team which 
        can share ideas and has the ability to grow both personally 
        and professionally. Growth as a designer is tremendously important 
        to me as I continuously strive to push my own boundaries. Design 
        is something I am genuinly passionate about and I pride myself 
        with the ability to engage the user.<br />
        Every experience is a design in itself.</p>
